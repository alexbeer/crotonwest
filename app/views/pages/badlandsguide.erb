        Easy. An accessible ¼ mile boardwalk leads through a break in the Badlands Wall known as "the Door" and to a view of the Badlands. From there, the maintained trail ends. Travel beyond this point is at your own risk. Watch for drop-offs.

   <div class="guide_topic_subtitle">Backcountry</div><br>
Permits are not currently required for overnight stays in the Badlands backcountry. Backcountry registers are located at the Medicine/Castle Trail Loop, Saddle Pass Trailhead, Conata Picnic Area, Sage Creek Basin Overlook, and the Sage Creek Campground.
<br><br>
Since most backcountry trips are not on designated trails, topographic maps are strongly recommended. (Can be found in park store).
<br><br>
The park is home to many burrowing animals. Watch your footing.
<br><br>
Campfires are not permitted. Use a backpacking stove.
<br><br>
The location of your campsite must be at least 0.5 miles from a road or trail and must not be visible from a roadway.
<br><br>
There is no potable or filterable water in the backcountry. Always carry at least one gallon of water per person per day.
<br><br>
Keep an eye on weather. Severe thunderstorms are common during the summer, so are days above 100ºF (38ºC). September and early October are the best backpacking months.

    <b>Cedar Pass Campground</b><br><br>
    Located near the Ben Reifel Visitor Center, the Cedar Pass Campground has 96 level sites with scenic views of the badlands formations.
    <br><br>
    Camping fees for up to two people are $22 per night per campsite, or $37 per night for campsites with electrical hook-ups. Each additional person is $4 per night. A dump station is available for a $1.00 per use fee. Cold running water, flush toilets, and covered picnic tables are available.
    <br><br>
    A limited section of the campground is open during the winter months.</p>
<hr>

    <b>Sage Creek Campground</b>
<br><br>
    Bison often wander through this primitive campground, located on the west side of the park's North Unit, near the Badlands Wilderness Area. Access is located off of the Sage Creek Rim Road, an unpaved road that may temporarily close after winter storms and spring rains. The road provides limited turnarounds for large recreational vehicles. Camping is free of charge. Pit toilets and covered picnic tables are available, but no water is available on-site. Sites at the Sage Creek Campground are available on a first-come, first-served basis and rarely fill to capacity. A portion of the Sage Creek Campground is designated for horse use.</p>
<hr>
    <p>Both campgrounds are open year-round, and camping is limited to 14 days. Due to fire danger, campfires are not permitted in either campground and collection of wood is prohibited.</p>

    In Badlands National Park, scientists have observed 39 mammal species, 9 reptile species, 6 amphibian species, 206 bird species, and 69 butterfly species.
The prairie animals are well adapted to their environment. They can handle climate extremes and find protection in these vast, open spaces. Most small prairie mammals either dig burrows or invade another animal's burrow for shelter. Others hibernate or become dormant in the cold of the winter.
